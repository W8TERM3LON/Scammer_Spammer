## Phishing sites getting on your nerves? Or you just realized you've been phished? Feed them fake data! Lots of it!

# <div align="center"> About

**ðŸš«PhishðŸš«** is a easy to use program written in Python used to combat phishing scams by feeding them massive amounts of fake logins, thus rendering their valid logins that they phished up near impossible to find nor use, at the same time forcing them to either temporarily close the site or abandon it completely due to the massive amounts of unusable data.

# <div align="center"> Features
- Allows you to feed massive amounts of fake usernames and passwords to phishing sites.
- Uses randomly generated first names, last names, order, numbers and variable length passwords.
- Picks between 9 different email providers to maximize legitimacy. (more can be added)
- Other parameters can also be included such as screen size and window resolution to further confuse up the scammers.
- Proxies can be used to prevent being IP blocked or to prevent IP leakage.
- Works on sites with HTTPS.
- Blocks redirects.
